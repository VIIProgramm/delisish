        All types of sushi consist of a basic ingredient — specifically cooked
        rice, to which other ingredients are added, most often fish and nori

        The history of sushi began with rice fields, where fish was fermented with
        vinegar, salt and rice, after which the rice was thrown away. The earliest
        form of the dish, today called naresushi, was created in Japan around the
        Yayoi period (Early Neolithic–Early Iron Age). During the Muromachi period
        (1336-1573), people began to eat rice as well as fish. During the Edo
        period (1603-1867), vinegar rather than fermented rice began to be used.

        A large nabe boiler filled with water and heated by a small gas burner is
        placed in the center of the table. Kombu and or dasi can be added to the
        water. When the water boils, the participants of the meal put their
        favorite ingredients into the pot as they eat. Since the meat is cut very
        thinly, it comes to readiness quite quickly. When the ingredients are
        sufficiently cooked, the guests take the pieces, dip them in the sauce and
        eat. The sauce can be different or even independently mixed &quot;to
        taste&quot; from several ready-made sauces and spices. Then the cooking
        procedure is repeated, usually there are several &quot;bookmarks&quot;
        until all the guests feel full. The last ingredient is often noodles,
        which are eaten together with the remains of the soup.

        Sukiyaki – consists of several traditional ingredients for Asian cuisine:
        cabbage, noodles, chrysanthemum tang ho (or spinach), broth and beef.
        Usually, a &quot;dish from a cauldron&quot; is prepared right on the
        table, having prepared a raw egg yolk for dipping juicy meat slices into
        it.

      >
        In modern Japanese encyclopedias on the history of nutrition, researchers
        derive the etymology of the name &quot;sukiyaki&quot; from the custom
        common among peasants in the XVII―XVIII centuries to fry (yaku) meat on a
        shovel or ploughshare (suki)
